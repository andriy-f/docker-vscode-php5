## Visual Studio Code for PHP
This docker image packages [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (`vscode`) with a curated list of extensions for PHP development. The goal of this image is to offer an easier, faster and free IDE, comparing to [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).

With this image, you don't need to install an "IDE" anymore, you simply run a Docker command, which will launch the `vscode`, creates the PHP enviroment, and then remove itself when you are done working.

## How to use

### Build image once

`docker build -t vscodephp5 .`

### Launch:

You can set up `bash` function for the command above, for example by adding following code to `~/.bashrc`:

```
vscodephp5() {
    xhost +local:docker;
    docker run -ti --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v "$PWD":/var/www/html -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY --device /dev/dri --name vscode --net="host" vscodephp5;
}
```

Once you set up the alias above, you can simply launch your "IDE" with simple command `vscodephp5`.

### Stop:

To stop the container and auto-remove it:
Just use `Ctrl+C`

### Use with other Docker image:

This image would work well with [insready/drupal-dev](https://hub.docker.com/r/insready/drupal-dev/), [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) remote debugging will simply work out of box.

## Configure Xdebug to work
This image makes assumption that the default remote server file path is at `/var/www/html/`. If this indeed is your remote file path, for example, you use [insready/drupal-dev](https://hub.docker.com/r/insready/drupal-dev/) for setting up your `Drupal` develppment enviroment, then you do not need additional configuration. Otherwise, you need to create a mapping between your remote file path, and the file path inside this container, which defaults to `/var/www/html/`.

To create a file path mapping between remote and local file system, you have to set the `localSourceRoot` and `serverSourceRoot` settings in your `launch.json`, for example:

```
"serverSourceRoot": "/var/www/html/",
"localSourceRoot": "${cwd}"
```

More documentation on this bit configuration can be fund [here](https://github.com/felixfbecker/vscode-php-debug#remote-host-debugging).

## List of `vscode` extensions included

* [PHP IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-intellisense)
* [PHP Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug)
* [Twig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whatwedo.twig)

## Known issues

* When you close the `vscode` UI, the container doesn't stop automatically. Therefore, you need to use `Ctrl+C` to stop the container therefore to remove it.
* This image has only been tested on Linux. The --net="host" might not work on Mac, therefore it needs one more step tweek to get `Xdebug` work out of box.
